        <h2> # Pre-departure Preparations </h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>## Expatrio (Blocked Account + Insurance) </dt>
            <dd>Expatrio is a service that helps you set up a blocked account and insurance, and I highly recommend it as it is very convenient. A blocked account is a special type of account required by the German government for foreigners to ensure them have enough money to cover basic living expenses each month. For a six-month exchange, you will need to deposit €934 * 6 = €5604 into the blocked account in advance. This money will then be transferred to your German bank account monthly. Both blocked account and insurance are essential for applying for a German visa, so it's better for you to prepare all these prerequisites at least two weeks before your visa appointment.</dd>
            <dt> ## Visa </dt>
            <dd>The spring semester starts in April, so the earliest time you can apply for a visa is January. I suggest booking your appointment in December on the German Institute Taipei’s website. If you’re going in a group of fewer than five people, you can use the group booking option. The required documents are clearly listed on the website, but if you're worried about forgetting something, just print everything which Expatrio provides. If you do forget something, you can always print at the 7-Eleven at the higher floor in Taipei 101. Make sure your photos were taken recently, at least different from the one on your passport! The German Institute Taipei's website says it takes about five weeks to get the visa, but we booked our appointment in late January and didn’t receive it until early March.</dd>
            <dt> ## Flight Tickets </dt>
            <dd>It's usually cheaper to buy tickets early, and many airlines offer discounted student fares, which are cheaper and allow you to bring more luggage. We bought round-trip tickets with Emirates for about NTD 28,000. Before booking, check for student discounts, as many airlines offer them, which can save you money or give you extra luggage allowance. Emirates has great service and overall quality, so I highly recommend them.</dd>
            <dt> ## Bank Account </dt>
            <dd> In Germany, you will need a bank account for receiving the money from your blocked account. Most of us used Revolut, but others such as N26 or Deutsche Bank are also popular. You can only open a Revolut account after receiving your visa, and the process takes about 10 minutes. I suggest topping up some money in Revolut or preparing a high reward credit card from Taiwan, so you can use it as soon as you arrive in Germany. Overall, I found Revolut easy to use, with a simple UI design, and transferring or receiving money is very easy.</dd>
            <dt> ##  Accomodation </dt>
            <dd> The Technical University of Munich (TUM) is one of the best universities in Germany. 
                 Munich itself has great public transportation and is very safe. 
                 However, for exchange students from my university, there’s one major drawback: TUM does not guarantee accommodation for us. If you don't get a spot in student dorms, you’ll have to find your own place, which can be challenging for exchange students who are only staying for six months. Munich has a competitive and expensive rental market. 
                 If you're lucky enough to get a dorm, rent (including utilities and internet) is about €350 per month. But if you have to find your own place, a shared room in the city center (WG) starts at €600, while a single apartment can cost over €1,000. There are also risks with communicating with landlords, as you won’t be able to view the property in advance. There are many reports of scams online. 
                 Due to these factors, we chose to live in a small town about 35 minutes away by train from Munich, which costs about €450 per month including furniture and internet.  After the exchange, we all agreed that the best approach is to find a short-term rental first and then spend two weeks focusing on finding a long-term place. </dd>    
            <dt> ### How to find accommodation </dt>
            <dd> Here are some websites and apps for finding accommodation: Tum Living, Immo Scout, WG Gesucht. We found our place through Tum Living, which is an official platform from the school, so it's more reliable. The downside is that the choices are limited, and we only found a place far from the main campus. Our daily commute to TUM was about an hour, and the train schedules were limited. The other two websites were recommended by other exchange students. They offer more options in the city center, but since they are public platforms, there’s a risk of scams, so be cautious.      
            <span style="font-style: italic;"> Note: If you still can't find a place before departure, you can try contacting our landlord named Albert: albert.gegg@agspro.de.</span></dd>
            
            <dt> ## Anmeldung </dt>
            <dd>Germany requires you to register (Anmeldung) at the local registration office if you stay for more than three months. You need to register at the local office where you are living. In Munich, due to the large population, you will have to queue for a long time for Anmeldung. However, if you live in rural area like us, you can avoid queuing. Don't forget to deregister when you leave Germany!</dd>

            <h2> # Transportation </h2>
            <dd>DB Navigator is a must-have transportation app in Germany, which you can use to check public transportation routes and buy tickets (including monthly passes). Trains in Germany are often delayed or change platforms suddenly, and this app provides real-time updates. Almost everyone buys a German monthly travel pass (Deutschland Ticket). The regular pass costs €49 per month, while the student pass is €29. The student pass is available starting in April, so if you arrive in Germany earlier, in March, you’ll need to buy a regular monthly pass. If you want to cancel the ticket, you must do so by the 10th of the previous month. For example, to cancel April's pass, you must cancel by March 10. This pass covers almost all public transport, except for long-distance trains like IC, ICE, etc. To avoid accidentally boarding a train that requires extra payment, you can set the DB Navigator to "local/regional transport only," ensuring the results only show trains you can use with your pass.</dd>
            <h2> # Travel </h2>
            <dd>
                Since it's not easy to come to Europe, it would be a huge regret not to travel while you're here! Most Taiwanese students doing exchanges in Europe feel the same, so it's easy to find travel companions. You can also search for travel buddies on the "Taiwanese Exchange Students in Europe" Facebook page. For transportation, your options include buses, trains, or planes. For buses, check out FlixBus and RegioJet. In our experience, RegioJet buses are more comfortable. Bus tickets are very cheap!<br>
                For short-distance trips, see if you can use your monthly pass, such as visiting Salzburg or Nuremberg. For longer trips, you may need to buy ICE tickets, which are cheaper if purchased in advance. If you buy them at the last minute, the prices can be shocking! Occasionally, DB offers significant discounts on tickets (for ages 19-26), making train travel much cheaper. If you plan to travel frequently by train, consider getting a BahnCard 25.<br>
                As for flights, check out Ryanair, which often offers super cheap tickets (for example, I bought a round-trip ticket to London for just over €30). I usually look for cheap flights first and then decide where to go XD. However, it's best to plan a few weeks in advance, as prices go up if you book too late. One last tip: flight prices during summer (July-August) are high, so don't expect cheap flights after exams if you're planning to explore Europe!<br>
                Many popular tourist attractions in Europe recommend buying tickets online in advance, so when planning your trip, check if you can buy tickets beforehand to avoid long lines!               
            </dd>
            <h2># Activities </h2>
            <dd> In here, activities refer to those organized by the university student community, such as Party Animals and Culture Creatures which were held at the beginning of the semester. Party Animals is a great way to meet new friends from all over the world, mostly from Europe. If you are not good at English, you might end up befriending more with other Asian students in your group. However, most of the games at Party Animals involve drinking, so if you don't drink, think carefully about whether you want to join! There's another event called Culture Creatures where you can meet new friends without drinking. Overall, we highly recommend Party Animals! If you're interested in other activities organized by student clubs, you can download the TUMi Events app to check for events which you are interested in.</dd>
            <h2># Courses </h2>
            <dd> The German academic system is quite different. Courses and exams are registered separately, and only the courses you pass will be shown on your transcript. So you can pick as many interesting courses as you like, and then decide which ones you want to take exams for. The semester is only 14 weeks long, so each class is packed with content, and the pace is fast. German students are also very diligent, asking and answering questions in class. The library is already packed in the first week. At the end of each course, students knock on their desks to thank their teachers, which was totally new to me. Keep in mind that most courses in Germany are graded entirely on the final exam, so it's important to keep up with the course to avoid cramming at the end. In addition to registering for courses at the beginning of the semester, you’ll need to register for exams from late May to June. You only get credits for the courses you pass, which I think is great. It gives students more flexibility compared to Taiwan, where we are not allowed to drop the courses after midterms.<br>
                <span id="course_list" style="font-weight: bold;">The following list is the courses I took：</span>  
                <ul>
                        <li> <a href="swlaben.html"> Software Engineering Lab </a> </li>
                        <li> <a href="ppen.html"> Parallel Programming </a> </li>
                        <li> <a href="cacomen.html"> Clinical Application of Computational Medicine </a> </li>
                        <li> <a href="germanen.html"> German A1.1 </a> </li>
                    </ul>
            </dd>
            <h2> # Outdoor Activities</h2>
            <dd>In addition to classes and traveling, there’s also plenty of time for extracurricular activities. You can check out the TUMi events for free food and socializing with other students. Around Munich, there are many places for day trips, and the school also hosts dorm parties you can attend.<br>
                I personally enjoy hiking, and Munich is surrounded by mountains, making it a perfect spot for hikes. I have a list of great hiking routes (feel free to contact me if you need the list). These hikes are usually day trips, a great way to spend your weekends. I recommend an app called komoot, which has thousands hiking routes. As for basketball, you can head to the streetball court near the university, where some of the best players in Munich gather.
