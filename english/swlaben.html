        <h2># Course Content</h2>
        <p> The course teaches how to collaborate with others on project development, helping students become familiar with using Git and other essential skills. I personally think these skills are very important, but I couldn't find similar courses at NYCU. Perhaps my university focuses on teaching more specialized knowledge, considering these skills can be developed once students enter the workforce.<br><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">The followings are the five important topics which the course covered.</span> 
            <ol>
                <li> Build System </li>
                <li> Unit Test </li>
                <li> Test Driven Development </li>
                <li> Development Tools </li>
                <li> Object Oriented Programming </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2># Teaching Method </h2>
        <p> The course was held in-person every two weeks, with lab sessions scheduled in the weeks without classes. The instructor speaks clearly, and the course content is straightforward, making it easy to understand.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2># Exams & Homeworks</h2>
        <p>The course includes five assignments and one final exam, with assignments making up 50% of the total grade and the exam also accounting for 50%. Assignments are submitted through GitLab. The course isn't hared, making it an ideal course for exchange students <del>who want to travel a lot</del>. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2># Experience</h2>
        <p>Since I didn't have any internship experience before this course, I initially struggled with using version control tools like Git. However, I learned many basic yet valuable concepts, which gave me a better understanding of the software development process. I'm also grateful to a senior in my group who helped me resolve several challenges along the way. </p>
