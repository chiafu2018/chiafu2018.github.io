        <h2> # Experience </h2>
        <p>Being my first solo journey abroad, I felt a mix of nervousness and excitement. Stepping off the plane, I was immediately struck by the hot and humid climate. Thankfully, the gracious hosts from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay made my arrival at the school comfortable. In the first week, I learned fundamental statistic, made some new friends, and immersed myself in the breathtaking landscapes of India. I tried numerous Indian foods, leaving me with unforgettable memories. <br>
        The second week brought more friends into my life as I continued to relish the wonders of India. I delved deeper into machine learning, exploring fascinating subjects like Neuromorphic computing, pattern recognition, and spiking neural networks. Besides intellectual pursuits, I explored breathtaking natural landscapes and some unfamiliar but tasty street foods. People I met there are so nice that I really enjoyed my time in India. I hope I can come here again in the future.  </p>
